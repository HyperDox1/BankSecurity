# BankSecurity
BankSecurity is an open-source discord bot coded in Python( using the library discord.py). It's purpose is to highlight security vulnerabilities inside both Python and Discord. BankSecurity simulates an economy with a banking system, with commands that contain built-in vulnerabilities. Have fun exploring these!

Vulnerabilities:

Python's str.format() function

Discord's guild chunking (internal member cache) 

Requirements for code:

pip install discord 

pip install python-dotenv
