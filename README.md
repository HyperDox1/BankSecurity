# BankSecurity
BankSecurity is an open-source discord bot coded in Python( using the library discord.py). It's purpose is to highlight security vulnerabilities inside both Python and Discord. BankSecurity simulates an economy with a banking system, with commands that contain built-in vulnerabilities.  Have fun exploring these!
